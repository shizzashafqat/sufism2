                <h2>The Sacred Roots: Mehfil-e-Sama</h2>
                <p>
                    Before modern stages, Qawwali lived entirely inside Sufi shrines such as Data Ganj Bakhsh. 
    It was part of a ritual practice called Sama, a form of spiritual listening that aimed to bring the listener into a state of 
    inner awakening known as wajd. Qawwali in this environment was performed for healing, prayer, and remembrance rather than 
    entertainment. Devotees gathered in crowded courtyards filled with candles, rose petals, and the fragrance of incense. 
    Families came seeking comfort, blessings, and a sense of belonging through the poetry of Sufi saints.

                <h2>The Shift: From Ritual to Recreation</h2>
                <p>
    In contemporary Pakistan, Qawwali has moved into new spaces. 
    It is now performed at weddings, restaurants, university festivals, and corporate events. 
    These settings often use loud sound systems, decorative lighting, and large stages. 
    Unlike shrine gatherings that focus on prayer and inner reflection, modern Qawwali is usually part of entertainment culture. 
    This shift shows how the music has become woven into the social and celebratory life of the country.

                <h2>The Digital Revival: Coke Studio</h2>
<p>
    Coke Studio, which began in 2008, introduced Qawwali to younger and global audiences. 
    The platform blends classical Sufi poetry with electronic, pop, and rock arrangements. 
    These productions make shrine-centered traditions accessible to people who may never have visited a dargah or heard traditional Qawwali live. 
    Through high quality recording and collaboration between genres, Coke Studio reshapes how listeners understand Sufi themes of longing, praise, and love.
</p>
<p>
    Digital platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, and Instagram allow Qawwali to circulate across borders and cultures. 
    For many young people, these online performances have become a primary way of engaging with Sufism, not through rituals or visits to saints’ shrines but through music that expresses identity and emotional connection.

                <h2>Global Echoes: The Diaspora</h2>
 <p>
    In the United Kingdom and the United States, artists such as Abi Sampa and groups like Riyaaz Qawwali bring the tradition into multicultural settings. 
    Their performances blend South Asian devotional poetry with orchestral instruments, choirs, and cinematic production. 
    Some groups also include Sikh hymns or Hindu devotional texts, showing how Qawwali can support interfaith dialogue and community building. 
    These adaptations demonstrate that Qawwali survives by evolving and that its emotional depth allows it to travel across languages and cultures.
