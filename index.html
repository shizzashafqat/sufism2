                <h2>The Sacred Roots: Mehfil-e-Sama</h2>
                <p>
                    Before modern stages, Qawwali lived entirely inside Sufi shrines such as Data Ganj Bakhsh. 
                    It was part of a ritual practice called Sama, a form of spiritual listening that aimed to bring the listener into a state of 
                    inner awakening known as wajd. Qawwali in this environment was performed for healing, prayer, and remembrance rather than 
                    entertainment. Devotees gathered in crowded courtyards filled with candles, rose petals, and the fragrance of incense. 
                    Families came seeking comfort, blessings, and a sense of belonging through the poetry of Sufi saints.

                <p>
                    In contemporary Pakistan, Qawwali has moved into new spaces. 
                    It is now performed at weddings, restaurants, university festivals, and corporate events. 
                    These settings often use loud sound systems, decorative lighting, and large stages. 
                    Unlike shrine gatherings that focus on prayer and inner reflection, modern Qawwali is usually part of entertainment culture. 
                    This shift shows how the music has become woven into the social and celebratory life of the country.

                <p>
                    Coke Studio, which began in 2008, introduced Qawwali to younger and global audiences. 
                    The platform blends classical Sufi poetry with electronic, pop, and rock arrangements. 
                    These productions make shrine-centered traditions accessible to people who may never have visited a dargah or heard traditional Qawwali live. 
                    Through high quality recording and collaboration between genres, Coke Studio reshapes how listeners understand Sufi themes of longing, praise, and love.

                <p>
                    Digital platforms such as YouTube, Spotify, and Instagram allow Qawwali to circulate across borders and cultures. 
                    For many young people, these online performances have become a primary way of engaging with Sufism, not through rituals or visits to saints’ shrines but through music that expresses identity and emotional connection.

                    In the United Kingdom and the United States, artists such as Abi Sampa and groups like Riyaaz Qawwali bring the tradition into multicultural settings. 
                    Their performances blend South Asian devotional poetry with orchestral instruments, choirs, and cinematic production. 
                    Some groups also include Sikh hymns or Hindu devotional texts, showing how Qawwali can support interfaith dialogue and community building. 
                    These adaptations demonstrate that Qawwali survives by evolving and that its emotional depth allows it to travel across languages and cultures.

                    <p>
                        Qawwali transformed because Sufism itself is flexible and responsive.
                        Historically, Sufi orders absorbed local languages, musical styles, and cultural practices to reach communities.
                        Qawwali developed as part of this adaptability. Persian poetry blended with Punjabi and Urdu.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This same flexibility appears today. Whether performed in shrines, wedding halls, or global studios, Qawwali continues to adjust to the needs, tastes, and spiritual language of each generation.

                        Your research shows that younger Pakistanis no longer meet Sufi ideas mainly through shrine visits.
                        Instead, they encounter Qawwali through Coke Studio, YouTube, Spotify, and wedding events.

                    <p>
                        The emotional core remains, but the ritual environment changes.
                        Where shrines create hal and wajd through collective spiritual presence, modern versions create emotional resonance through sound design, cinematic staging, and digital circulation.

                    <p>
                        Traditional Qawwali was a form of worship. It aimed to move listeners closer to God.
                        Your findings show that in modern contexts, Qawwali carries new layers of meaning:
                        it has become entertainment, a symbol of cultural heritage, and a marker of national identity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The music may not always be devotional, but it remains emotionally powerful.
                        The themes of divine love, humility, longing, and unity become cultural values that resonate even when the ritual context is no longer present.

                        Groups such as Riyaaz Qawwali and artists like Abi Sampa reshape the tradition for multicultural audiences.
                        Their arrangements include orchestras, choirs, cinematic percussion, and interfaith texts.

                        This shows that Qawwali’s message can travel across languages and cultures while staying rooted in Sufi themes of love and transcendence.

                    Qawwali changes shape whenever society changes.
                    It began as a devotional act rooted in the world of Sufi saints and continued through communal rituals inside shrines.
                    Today it lives on global stages, wedding halls, and digital networks.

                    "Qawwali survives because it transforms.
                    Its spiritual intentions shift across settings,
                    but the emotional truth of longing, humility, and love continues to connect people."
